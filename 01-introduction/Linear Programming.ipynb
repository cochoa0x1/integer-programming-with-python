    "At some point in my calculus education I developed a simple rule, when in doubt set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x. You might recall doing this, and the reason for doing it is because for a smooth function its local maximum and minimum are found at places where the derivate is zero. Imagine if you have curve shaped like a hill, now if you go up the hill and at some point go over the top (the max), if you keep going you will start traveling downward. If you went from increasing to decreasing, the calculus argument was that at some point your rate of increase was zero and that would be at the top. Largely this works very well. It leads nicely to many optimization rules, but it breaks down a little bit when we don't have a curve. In particular it breaks down when our domain is the set of integers.\n",

    "### Enter the real world, everything is a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times the problems are stated as find the \"best\" route, or find the \"best\" fitting function. For us to solve these problems, we need to model what \"best\" means. We need to mathematically describe a quantity to either maximize or minimize. For example we might seek select the route that minimizes the total distance travelled by a salesman (traveling salesman). Or if we were trying to fit a curve to some data, we might minimize the error between the predicted curve and the data (regression). We might try to select paths in a distribution network that maximize flow (network flow problems) etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "A linear program is one where the metric or objective to minimize is linear and the constraints are linear, i.e.:\n",

    "### $$f(x) = a_{0}x_{0} + a_{1}x_{1}+ \\dots + a_{n}x_{n}$$\n",

    "### continuous vs integer (and mixed integer!)\n",
    "\n",
    "If all the variables are continuous life is good. If however the variables must take on integer solutions, for example, 1,2,3... then life can be very hectic. Problems with integer only solutions are integer programming problems and they can be very difficult to solve if a solution exists at all! When you have a mix of variable types, you have a mixed integer problem. While many algorithms exist to solve all of these types, the most common for continuous programs is the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) and for mixed integer the insanely clever [branch cut and bound method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut) works very well. We will talk about these later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do you know if the program is linear?** just make sure the expression and the constraints are a combination of constants multiplied by some variables. If any of variables are multiplied or divided by another, you are in trouble and you have a harder problem. It is also important that the variables be continuous. If for example Most interesting problems are not linear, however there are a number approximations and tricks that can turn non linear programs into linear ones. We will explore this later. For now, lets solve our first program using [PuLP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP/1.6.5).\n"
